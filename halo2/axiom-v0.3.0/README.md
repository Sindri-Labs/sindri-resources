# v0.3.0 Circuit Requirements

- Upload all your rust language source code for a circuit
  - include the manifest `Cargo.toml`
  - exclude executable targets
- All code imports must use relative paths
- Your main circuit struct should be public
- Indicate the main circuit upon which we build our prover via the `Sindri.json` file
- Your main circuit should implement the following functionalities:
  - `circuit_input::default()`
  - `circuit_input.from_json(path)`
  - `circuit_input.create_circuit(builder_type, breakpoints)`
  - `circuit_builder.break_points()`
  - `circuit_builder.instance()`

For greater clarity regarding the three functions above, either examine the **v0.3.0** examples or see our gitbook walkthrough.

## Structure
In this hypothetical example, the user has a main circuit which is defined in the top level of src which references some inner circuitry defined in the chips folder.  For their offline proof testing, they build `local_prover` and even though Forge doesn't require any of the code in `src/bin/local_prover.rs`, it should be included so that the entire package can be built and referenced by our prover binaries.
```
my_repo/
    src/
        bin/
            local_prover.rs
        chips/
            mod.rs
        circuit.rs
    Cargo.toml
    Sindri.json
    config.json [OPTIONAL]
```

The file `Sindri.json` specifies what you have named your package and how to reference the circuit
```
{
    "PACKAGE_NAME": "my-circuit",
    "CLASS_NAME": "circuit::myCircuit",
    "DEGREE": "12",
    "THREAD_BUILDER": "GateThreadBuilder",
    "HALO2_BASE_VERSION": "0.3.0"
}
```
The file `config.json` specifies any environment variables that are necessary to define your circuit configuration.  For example, in the `float_radius` circuit we have
```
{
    "LOOKUP_BITS": "12"
}
```
In our prover binary, we would call `std::env::set_var(LOOKUP_BITS, "12");` as a precursor to anything else. This implicitly passes through the `create_circuit` function anytime a concrete circuit is configured, and in the case of the `float_radius` example, specifies the size of the lookup table.

If you do not require any environment variables to be set you can either exclude the file entirely or include an empty JSON structure: `{}`.
