The code in `src/main.rs` will create a circuit, upload, and initiate compile.  Then from that compiled circuit, it will initiate a proof. From this directory, you can call
```
cargo run
```
which builds the executable and runs it.

DISCLAIMER: This code does minimal return code processing and could be improved to return proofs or keys to a user.
