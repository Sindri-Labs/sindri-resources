# Rust Quickstart

This rust quickstart provides a minimal example of compiling and proving a circuit with Sindri's API via the [reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/) HTTP request client.

## Usage 
Assuming you are in the `/reference_code/quickstart_rust/` directory, you can build and run the main the package via 
```
SINDRI_API_KEY=<your-api-key> cargo run
```
