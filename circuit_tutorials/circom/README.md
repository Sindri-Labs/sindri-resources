# Circom Circuit Tutorials

In this directory, we provide a handful of Circom circuits tutorials which have been prepared to be used with Sindri.
You may find them useful as a reference when writing your own circuits; or you may use these as circuit uploads if you are just beginning to try out Sindri.

See the [Sindri Circom Documentation](https://sindri-labs.github.io/docs/how-to-guides/frameworks/circom/) for detailed information.
