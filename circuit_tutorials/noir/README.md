# Sample Noir Circuits

In this directory, we provide a handful of Noir circuits which have already been prepared to use with Sindri. You may find them useful as a reference when writing your own circuits; or you may use these as circuit uploads if you are just beginning to try out Sindri.

See Sindri's documentation for more complete instructions.
